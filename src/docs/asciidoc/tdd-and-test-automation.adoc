== Some Definintions
[%step]
* **Test Automation**
** Writing and running repeatable verifications 
** of the behaviour of an individual piece of code
** ..., or an entire system
** using tools such as JUnit or Selenium

== Some Definintions
* **TDD**
** A method of incrementally designing and implementing features
in a software system
** by alternately 
*** specifying expected behaviour in automated tests
*** writing production code to meet the specification
** and periodically improving the design through refactoring
*** changing the implementation without changing the behaviour


== What makes a good automated test
The value that a team gets from automated testing **must** be greater
than the effort that they expend creating and maintaining those tests.

[%step]
* Benefits include
** Regression testing
** Fast feedback on changes
** 'Documentation' on the behaviour of the system

== What makes a good automated test
* A valuable test
** Is __fast__
** Fails for one reason (specific)
** Expresses the scenario and intent of the test

== Anatomy of an Automated Test

[%step]
* **Arrange**
** Set-up the system / module under test
** e.g. set configuration parameters, populate DB tables
* **Act**
** Invoke some action(s) on the system / module
** e.g. login and submit a form with valid values
* **Assert**
** Verify the expected state
** e.g. at the correct page, values in the DB as expected
