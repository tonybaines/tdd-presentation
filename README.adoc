= reveal.js Example

Copied from http://danhyun.github.io/asciidoctor-gradle-examples/

An example project that demonstrates how to convert AsciiDoc to reveal.js using the Asciidoctor Gradle plugin.

== Usage

Convert the AsciiDoc to reveal.js by invoking the 'asciidoctor' goal:

 $ ./gradlew clean asciidoctor

== IntelliJ

If you're using IntelliJ you can generate the IDE's files via:

 $ ./gradlew idea

Open the file _build/asciidoc/reveal/example-manual.html_ in your browser to see the generated revealjs file.

== Live Reload Support

The Gradle build also can support http://asciidoctor.org/docs/editing-asciidoc-with-live-preview/#livereload[Live Reload]

Start by running the build with the watch task

 $ ./gradlew asciidoctor watch

This ensures if you modify example-manual.adoc then everything is rebuilt.

Open another terminal and run the liveReload task:

 $ ./gradlew liveReload

Now you can use the https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en[Chrome] or http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86242-how-do-i-install-and-use-the-browser-extensions-[Firefox] plugins to automatically reload your browser when the build completes.

IMPORTANT: After installing the Chrome LiveReload extension, you need to check the "Allow access to file URLs" checkbox in Tools > Extensions > LiveReload in order for it to work with local files.

Now try editing example-manual.adoc and watching your browser.
After a brief wait you will observe that the browser is automatically updated with your changes.
